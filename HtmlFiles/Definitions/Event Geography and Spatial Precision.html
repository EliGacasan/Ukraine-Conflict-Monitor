<h3>
    Event Geography
</h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800;">
    There are up to six different types of spatial information recorded for each ACLED event:
    <ol>
        <li>the continental sub-region in which the event occurred;</li>
        <li>the country in which the event occurred and its associated ISO code;</li>
        <li>the name of the first, second and third level administrative zones that the specific
            location is found in according to GIS-based assessments and updated
            administrative codes;</li>
        <li>the name of the specific location of an event;</li>
        <li>the geographic coordinates of that specific location; and</li>
        <li>a spatial precision code.</li>
    </ol>
    The most specific location for an event is sought for each ACLED code, using multiple
sources to triangulate better location information.

<p><b> Spatial precision codes</b></p>
<p style="word-wrap:break-word; width: 800;">
    If the report notes a particular town, and coordinates are available for that town, the
    highest precision level “1” is recorded. If the source material notes that activity took
    place in a small part of a region, and notes a general area, a town with georeferenced
    coordinates to represent that area is chosen and the geo-precision code will note “2” for
    “part of region”. If activity occurs near a town or a city, this same precision code is
    employed. If a larger region is mentioned, the closest natural location noted in reporting
    (like “border area”, “forest” or “sea”, among others) is chosen to represent the region –
    or a provincial capital is used if no other information at all is available – and is noted
    with precision level “3”. No ACLED event is associated with the “country” as the smallest
    location unit available. When events occur in neighbourhoods of large cities and distinct
    neighbourhood/district coordinates are available, these are used to identify the
    sub-urban area. This location is coded as: “City Name [hyphen] district name” (e.g.
    ‘Mosul-Old City’) in the ‘LOCATION’ column. If information about the specific
    neighbourhood/district is not known, the location is coded at the city level (e.g. ‘Mosul’).
    In both cases, geo-precision 1 is used. The hyphenate feature allows for users to
    aggregate events by city if needed.
