    <h3>Definitions of ACLED Event and Sub-Event Types</h3>
    <div>
      <p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
        ACLED collects and codes reported information on political violence,
        demonstrations (rioting and protesting) and select non-violent,
        politically important events. It aims to capture the modes, frequency
        and intensity of political violence and opposition as it occurs.
        Political violence is defined as the use of force by a group with a
        political purpose or motivation. ACLED records political violence
        through its constituent events, the intent of which is to produce a
        comprehensive overview of all forms of political disorder, expressed
        through violence and demonstrations, within and across states. A
        politically violent event is a single altercation where often force is
        used by one or more groups toward a political end, although some
        non-violent instances – including protests and strategic developments –
        are included in the dataset to capture the potential pre-cursors or
        critical junctures of a violent conflict. The fundamental unit of
        observation in ACLED is the event. Events involve designated actors –
        e.g. a named rebel group, a militia or state forces.1 They occur at a
        specific named location (identified by name and geographic coordinates)
        and on a specific day. Researchers work to ensure that the most specific
        location and time possible are recorded. ACLED currently codes for six
        types of events and twenty-five types of sub-events, both violent and
        non-violent, that may occur during a period of political violence and
        disorder.
