<h3>Demonstrations: Protests</h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
  A protest is defined as a public demonstration in which the participants do
  not engage in violence, though violence may be used against them. Events
  include individuals and groups who peacefully demonstrate against a political
  entity, government institution, policy, group, tradition, businesses or other
  private institutions. Events that are not coded as protests are symbolic
  public acts such as displays of flags or public prayers (unless they are
  accompanied by a demonstration), protests in legislatures such as
  parliamentary walkouts or MPs staying silent, strikes (unless they are
  accompanied by a demonstration), and individual acts such as self-harm actions
  (e.g. individual immolations or hunger strikes). Protesters are noted by
  generic terms (e.g. ‘Protesters (Country)’); if representing a group, the name
  of that group is recorded in the respective associated actor column.

  <p><b>Peaceful protest</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type is used when demonstrators are engaged in a protest
    while not engaging in violence or other forms of rioting behaviour and are
    not faced with any sort of force or engagement. Interaction terms here include: 60, 66, or 67.

  <p><b>Protest with intervention</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type should be used when individuals are engaged in a
    peaceful protest during which there is an attempt to disperse or suppress
    the protest without serious/lethal injuries being reported or the targeting
    of protesters with lethal weapons. Additionally, this sub-event type should
    cover any instance where armed groups or rioters interact with peaceful
    protesters without resulting in serious/lethal injuries. Interaction terms here include: 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 68.

  <p><b>Excessive force against protesters</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type should be used when individuals are engaged in a
    peaceful protest and are targeted with violence by an actor leading to (or
    if it could lead to) serious/lethal injuries. Interaction terms here include: 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, 68.
