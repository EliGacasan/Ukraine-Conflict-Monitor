<h3>Event Time</h3>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800;">
    Three forms of temporal information are found in each ACLED code:
    <ol>
        <li>the date of each event;</li>
        <li>the year; and</li>
        <li> the temporal precision</li>
    </ol>
    Dates are a necessary component of each ACLED event. ACLED events are atomic as
    events are coded by day; if a military campaign in an area starts on March 1, 1999 and
    lasts until March 5, 1999 with violent activity reported on each day, this is coded as five
    different events in ACLED, with a different date for each entry. This episode would not
    be entered as a single campaign of violence. This allows ACLED to record the exact
    number of active days. Events which source material note occurred in the space of three
    months – like long-running protests – are only coded for the days in which reported
    activity took place (not as 90+ days). This avoids over-counting event occurrence.

<p><b>Time precision codes</b></p>
<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800px;">
    If sources include an actual date of an event, a time precision code of “1” is entered. If
    sources note that an event happened during a specific week or in the weekend, “2” is
    noted in the time precision field and the middle of that week (or of the weekend) is used
    as the reference date. If sources note only that an event took place within a particular
    month, without reference to the particular date, the month mid-point is chosen unless
    the beginning or end of the month is noted (in which case, the first and last date are
    used, respectively) and “3” is noted as the time precision level. ACLED does not include
    events with less temporal information.
