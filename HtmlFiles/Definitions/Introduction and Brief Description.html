  The ACLED project codes reported information on the type, agents, location, date, and
other characteristics of political violence events, demonstrations and select politically
relevant non-violent events. ACLED focuses on tracking a range of violent and
non-violent actions by political agents, including governments, rebels, militias, identity
groups, political parties, external actors, rioters, protesters and civilians.

      <li>Tracking rebel, militia and government activity over time and space</li>
      <li>Recording violent acts between and across non-state groups, including political and identity militias</li>
      <li>Recording political violence by unnamed agents, as violent groups may remain unnamed for strategic reasons</li>
      <li>Recording attacks on civilians by all violent political agents</li>
      <li>Distinguishing between territorial transfers of military control from
        governments (and their affiliates) to non-state agents and vice versa</li>
      <li>Collecting information on rioting and protesting</li>
      <li>Tracking non-violent ‘strategic developments’ representing crucial junctures in
        periods of political violence (e.g. recruitment drives, peace talks, high-level
        arrests)</li>

    ACLED data are derived from a wide range of local, regional and national sources and
    the information is collected by trained data experts worldwide. An updated overview of
    ACLED’s current coverage is available on the ACLED website.
    ACLED data are available to the public and are released in real-time. Data can be
    downloaded through the data export tool on the ACLED website or can be accessed
    through the API (a manual is available online). Curated data files – such as regional data
    files, or aggregate country-year files – can also be accessed online on the ACLED website.
    Further information on ACLED’s coding choices are available on the methodology page
    of the ACLED website.
