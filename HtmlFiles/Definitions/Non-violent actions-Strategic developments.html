<h3>Demonstrations: Riots</h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
    This event type captures contextually important information regarding the activities of
violent groups that is not itself recorded as political violence, yet may trigger future
events or contribute to political dynamics within and across states. The inclusion of such
events is limited, as its purpose is to capture pivotal events within campaigns of political
violence. They typically include a disparate range of events, such as recruitment drives,
looting, incursions, as well as the location and date of peace talks and the arrests of
high-ranking officials or large groups. While it is rare for fatalities to be reported as a
result of such events, they can occur in certain cases – e.g. the suspicious death of a
high-ranking official, accidental detonation of a bomb resulting in the bomber being
killed, etc.

<div>
  <p><b>Arrests</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type is used whenever state forces or other actors exercising de facto
control over a territory either detain a particularly significant individual or engage in
mass arrests.
  </p>
  <p><b>Change to group/activity</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type is used to code significant changes in the activity or structure of
armed groups. It can cover anything from the creation of a new rebel group or a
paramilitary wing of the security forces, “voluntary” recruitment drives, movement of
forces or any other non-violent security measures enacted by armed actors. This
sub-event type can also be used if an armed group is absorbed into a different (existing)
armed group or to track large-scale defections.
  </p>
  <p><b>Disrupted weapons use</b></p>
  <p>This sub-event type is used to capture all instances in which an event of
    ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ is prevented from occurring, or whenever armed actors
    seize significant caches of weapons. It includes the safe defusal of an explosive, the
    accidental detonation of explosives by the alleged responsible of planting it, the
    interception of explosives in the air, as well as the seizure of weapons or weapon
    platforms such as jets, helicopters, tanks, etc. Note that in cases where a group other
    than the one who planted an explosive is attempting to render an explosive harmless
    and it goes off, this is coded under the event type ‘Explosions/Remote violence’, as the
    explosive has harmed someone other than the group that planted it.</p>
 <p><b>Headquarters or base established</b></p>
 <p>This sub-event type is used when a violent group establishes a permanent or
    semi-permanent base or headquarters. There are few, if any, cases where opposition
    groups other than rebels can also establish a headquarters or base (e.g. AMISOM forces
    in Somalia).</p>
<p><b>Looting/property destruction</b></p>
<p>This sub-event type is used when organised armed groups engage in looting or seizing
    goods or property other than weapons or weapon systems (in which case the sub-event
    type ‘Disrupted weapons use’ should be used). This can occur during raiding or after the
    capture of villages or other populated places by armed groups that occur without
    reported violence.</p>
<p><b>Non-violent transfer of territory</b></p>
<p>This sub-event type is used in situations in which rebels, governments, or affiliates of
    both acquire control of a location without engaging in a violent interaction with another
    group. Rebels establishing control of a location without any resistance is an example of
    this event.</p>
<p><b>Other</b></p>
<p>This sub-event type is used to cover any significant development that does not fall into
    any of the other ‘Strategic developments’ sub-event types. Examples include the
    occurrence of a coup, the displacement of civilian population as a result of fighting, or
    the discovery of mass graves.</p>
