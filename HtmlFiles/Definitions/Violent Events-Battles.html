    Violent Events: Battles
</h3>

<p style = 'word-wrap: break-word; width: 800;'> 
    ACLED defines a battle as “a violent interaction between two politically organized armed
groups at a particular time and location.” Battles can occur between armed and
organised state, non-state, and external groups, and in any combination therein. There is
no fatality minimum necessary for inclusion.
Although the term “battle” may be used here to describe various kinds of encounters
between parties – e.g. “the ceasefire is broken” – battles must be violent events involving
at least two armed and organized actors. One-sided interactions – e.g. reports of shots
fired into the air without a target – are categorized as ‘Strategic developments’. Violence against unarmed civilians is categorized as ‘Violence against civilians’,
although civilians can also be harmed as “collateral damage” in ‘Battles’ or
‘Explosions/Remote violence’ events. When harmed in the event of a battle or
explosions, a separate civilian-specific event is not recorded, but the fatalities, if any, are
aggregated in the “Fatalities” column. The specific elements of that definition are as follows:

    <ul style = "list-style-type:circle; word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
        <li> A violent interaction is the exchange of armed force, or the use of armed force
at close distance, between armed groups capable of inflicting harm upon the
opposing side.</li>
        <li>Organized armed groups are collective actors assumed to be operating
cohesively around an agenda, identity, or political purpose, using weapons to
inflict harm. These groups frequently have a designated name and stated
agenda.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Armed clash</b></p>
    <p>If armed, organized groups engage in a battle, and no reports indicate a change in
        territorial control, the correct sub-event type is an ‘Armed clash’.</p>
    <p><b>Non-state actor overtakes territory</b></p>
    <p>When a non-state actor wins control and/or subdues government forces, and/or has
        won territory in which they can now act with impunity and are regarded as having a
        monopoly of force within that territory, ‘Non-state actor overtakes territory’ is the
        correct sub-event type. Short-lived territorial exchanges that do not last for more than
        one day are coded as ‘Armed clash’.
        In cases where government and non-state forces fight many times in a location before a
        non-state group gains control, only the final territorial acquisition is coded as ‘Non-state
        actor overtakes territory’. All other battles in that location are coded as ‘Armed clash’. 
        This sub-event can also be used to note the transfer of control from one non-state group
        to another by violence.</p>
    <p><b>Government regains territory</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is used to describe cases where government forces or their affiliates
        fighting against competing state forces or against a non-state group regain control of a
        location. This code is only used for re-establishment of government control and not for
        dual non-state violence. Short-lived territorial exchanges that do not last for more than
        one day are coded as ‘Armed clash’.</p>
