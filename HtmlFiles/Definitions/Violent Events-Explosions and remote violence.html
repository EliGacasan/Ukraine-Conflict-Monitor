<h3>
    Violent Events: Explosions/Remote violence
</h3>

<p style = 'word-wrap: break-word; width: 800;'> 
    ACLED defines ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ as “one-sided violent events in which the
tool for engaging in conflict creates asymmetry by taking away the ability of the target to
respond”. The tools used in instances of ‘Explosions/Remote violence’ are explosive
devices, including, but not limited to, bombs, grenades, improvised explosive devices
(IEDs), artillery fire or shelling, missile attacks, heavy machine gun fire, air or drone
strikes, or chemical weapons. Suicide attacks implicating the use of bombs also fall
under this category. When any instance of ‘Explosion/Remote violence’ is reported in
the context of an ongoing battle, they are merged and coded as a single battle event.
‘Explosions/Remote violence’ can be waged on both armed agents or on civilians. When
accounting for all attacks on civilians, explosions/remote violence with civilian targets
should be included.

<div>
    <p><b>Chemical weapon</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is coded whenever chemical weapons are used in warfare in the
        absence of any other engagement. ACLED considers chemical weapons all substances
        listed in the Schedule 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention (implemented by the 
        Organization for the Prohibition of Chemcial Weapons), including sarin gas,
        mustard gas, chlorine gas, and anthrax. Napalm, white phosphorous, as well as tear gas
        and other non-lethal crowd control substances, are not considered to be chemical
        weapons within this sub-event type.</p>
    <p><b>Air/drone strike</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is coded whenever air or drone strikes have occurred in the absence
        of any other engagement. Please note that any air-to-ground attacks fall under this
        sub-event type, including attacks by helicopters that do not involve any exchange of fire
        with forces on the ground.</p>
    <p><b>Suicide bomb</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is coded whenever a suicide bombing occurs in the absence of any
        other engagement (other engagement could include gun fire against other armed groups
        or civilians). It also includes suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device
        (SVBIED) attacks.</p>
    <p><b>Shelling/artillery/missile attack</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is coded whenever a long-range artillery or missile system is used in
        the absence of any other engagement. It also includes attacks described as shelling, the
        use of artillery either stand-alone or tank based, mortars, or guided missiles. Planes shot
        down by rockets or artillery fall under this sub-event type; unmanned drones shot
        down, however, given no human targets, are coded as an interception under ‘Disrupted
        weapons use’ (see below). Similarly, while planes shot down using rockets or artillery
        fall under this sub-event type, an interception of a strike itself (such as by the Iron Dome
        of Israel) are coded as ‘Disrupted weapons use’ as well given no human targeting.
        Rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) are coded under the ‘Shelling/artillery/missile
        attack’ sub-event type as opposed to ‘Grenade’ given their similarities to artillery.</p>
    <p><b>Remote explosive/landmine/IED</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is coded whenever remotely- or victim-activated devices are
        detonated in the absence of any other engagement. Examples include landmines,
        improvised explosive devices (IEDs) whether alone or attached to a vehicle, or any other
        sort of remotely detonated or triggered explosive. Unexploded ordinances (UXO) also
        fall under this category.
        Suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (SVBIED) are coded as ‘Suicide
        bomb’ (see above), while the safe defusal of an explosive or its accidental detonation by
        the actor who planted it (with no other casualties reported) are coded under ‘Disrupted weapons use'.</p>
    <p><b>Grenade</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is used when a grenade or another explosive is thrown in the
        absence of any other engagement. Events involving “crude bombs” (such as Molotov
        cocktails, firecrackers, cherry bombs, petrol bombs, etc.) as well as ‘stun grenades’ are
        not coded in this category but are included under either ‘Riots’ or ‘Strategic
        developments’ depending on the context where they occurred.</p>
