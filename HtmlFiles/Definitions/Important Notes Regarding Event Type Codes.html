<h3>
    Important Notes Regarding Event Type Codes
</h3>


<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
    One or more events can occur in the same location on the same day. If two events
    between the same actors in the same location are reported, they are typically noted as a
    single aggregate event. For example:
    <ul>
        <ol>
            a rebel group fights with government forces in a town and wins control. Rebel
    artillery strikes are reported throughout the day. In this case, only a single battle
    event between the rebels and the government forces is recorded;
        </ol>
        <ol>
            on the same day, demonstrators stage peaceful protests and also engage in
    clashes with the security forces. In this case, a single riot event is recorded.
        </ol>

    </ul>
    
    ACLED researchers do not ‘double count’ events. For example, if civilians are killed in
    the context of a battle, then their reported fatalities will be added to the total number of
    fatalities reported for the event and this will be noted in the ‘NOTES’ section, but it will
    not constitute a separate event. In battle events, civilians are never coded as associate
    actors as both parties are assumed to engage in violence. Further, if an attack – such as an air strike - is meant to target militants, but does also
    hurt civilians, civilians are coded as associate actors, and again the fatalities, if
    mentioned, are aggregated together. In cases where a bombing occurs with a vague and
    unspecified military target (e.g. a bombing occurs in a city that has some militants in it,
    rather than an area controlled and actively used by militants), but civilians are the main
    group affected, they will be coded in the ‘ACTOR 2’ column. Militants may appear in the
    ‘ASSOC_ACTOR_1’ and ‘ASSOC_ACTOR_2’ columns.

    However, if another event type involving different actors occurs, it is coded separately.
    Hence, it is possible to have multiple events--involving distinct actors--occur in the same
    location on the same day. For example, if armed violence purposely targets civilians and
    is separately reported on the same day and location of a battle, two events are coded to
    accurately capture the battle and the distinct civilian attack.
    In most cases, an event requires two actors, noted in columns ‘ACTOR1’ and ‘ACTOR2’.
    However, event types ‘Explosions/Remote violence’, ‘Riots’, ‘Protests’, and ‘Strategic
    developments’ can include one-sided events. If more than two actors are reported, only
    the most important engagement is coded, and the additional groups may be coded as
    associated actor depending on the context (for example, police forces intervening to
    disperse rioters). The order of actors has no meaning in the ACLED system, barring cases
    of ‘Violence against civilians’, in which the victim is always coded as Actor2.
