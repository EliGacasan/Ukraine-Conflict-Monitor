<h3>Relationships to Other Datasets</h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
    The conflicts coded in ACLED are generally compatible with other conflict data
    collections. ACLED information may be joined with many, if not all, other conflict
    datasets by country, year, actor or specific locality. ACLED data are event data, and as
    such, care should be given in joining its information with other datasets using different
    units of analysis (e.g. campaigns of violence instead of violent events by day).
    As ACLED codes a wide range of constituent events for periods and areas affected by
    political violence and disorder, the information collected is far more numerous than
    datasets that focus on specific forms of violence (e.g. civil war, terrorism as defined by
    targeting of civilians by non-state actors alone, or those with fatality thresholds for
    inclusion) or only campaigns of violence instead of events.
