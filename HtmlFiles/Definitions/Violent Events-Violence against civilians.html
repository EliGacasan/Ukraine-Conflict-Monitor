<h3>
    Violent Events: Violence against civilians
</h3>

<p style = 'word-wrap: break-word; width: 800;'> 
    ACLED defines ‘Violence against civilians’ as violent events where an organised armed
group deliberately inflicts violence upon unarmed non-combatants. By definition,
civilians are unarmed and cannot engage in political violence. The perpetrators of such
acts include state forces and their affiliates, rebels, militias, and external/other forces.
In cases where the identity and actions of the victims are in question (e.g. the target may
be employed as a police officer), ACLED determines that if a person is harmed or killed
while unarmed and unable to either act defensively or counter-attack, this is an act of
‘Violence against civilians’. There is no minimum number of civilian fatalities needed to
qualify as an ACLED event.
‘Violence against civilians’ includes attempts at inflicting harm (e.g. beating, shooting,
torture, rape, mutilation, etc.) or forcibly disappearing (e.g. kidnapping and
disappearances) civilian actors.

    <p><b>Sexual violence</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is used when any individual (regardless of gender) is targeted with
        sexual violence. ‘Sexual violence’ is defined largely as any action that inflicts harm of a
        sexual nature. This means that it is not limited to solely penetrative rape, but would also
        include actions like public stripping, sexual torture of men, etc.</p>
    <p><b>Attack</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is used when civilians are targeted with any violence by an
        organised armed actor. Attacks of sexual nature are coded as ‘Sexual violence’.</p>
    <p><b>Abduction/forced disappearance</b></p>
    <p>This sub-event type is used when an actor engages in the abduction or forced
        disappearance of civilians, without reports of further violence. If fatalities or serious
        injuries are reported as a consequence of the forced disappearance, the event is coded as
        ‘Attack’ instead.
        Note that this sub-event type does not cover state-sanctioned arrests, unless they are
        reported to have been conducted extra-judicially. By contrast, non-state groups can
        never engage in arrests, and their activity engaging in “arresting” is typically coded using
        this sub-event type.</p>
