<h3>Demonstrations: Riots</h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
    ‘Riots’ are violent events where demonstrators or mobs engage in disruptive acts,
    including but not limited to rock throwing, property destruction, etc. They may target
    other individuals, property, businesses, other rioting groups or armed actors. Rioters are
    noted by generic terms (e.g. ‘Rioters (Country)’); if representing a group, the name of
    that group is recorded in the respective ‘Associated actor’ column. Rioters may begin as
    peaceful protesters, or may be intent on engaging in spontaneous and disorganized
    violence from the beginning of their actions. Contrary to armed groups, rioters do not
    use sophisticated weapons such as guns, knives or swords. “Crude bombs” (e.g. Molotov
    cocktails, petrol bombs, firecrackers) may be used in rioting behaviour

  <p><b>Violent demonstration</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type is used when a group of individuals engages in a demonstration
involving violence. Examples of rioting behaviour include vandalism; road-blocking using barricades, burning tires, or other material; other types of violent and/or
destructive behaviour are also included here.
  </p>
  <p><b>Mob violence</b></p>
  <p>
    This sub-event type is used when rioters violently interact with other rioters, another
armed group or civilians, outside of demonstrations and without the use of lethal
weapons like guns, knives, swords, etc. A mob is defined as “a large crowd of people,
especially one that is disorderly and intent on causing trouble or violence.” Note that this
type of violence can also include (unarmed or crudely armed) vigilante mobs clashing
with other armed groups or attacking civilians. Vigilante groups that are more than
crudely armed are not considered to be spontaneous mobs and rather are assumed to be
organized and would hence not be included here.
