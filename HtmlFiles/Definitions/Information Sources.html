<h3>Information Sources</h3>

<p style="word-wrap: break-word; width: 800">
    ACLED tracks reported political violence from four main types of sources:
<ol>
    <li>local, regional, national and continental media reviewed on a daily basis;</li>
    <li>reports from NGOs or international organisations used to supplement media
        reporting;</li>
    <li>selected social media accounts, including Twitter and Telegram; and</li>
    <li>information and data provided through partnerships with local conflict
        observatories in hard-to-access cases.</li>
</ol>
ACLED researchers use thousands of distinct sources in more than twenty different
languages. The result is the most comprehensive and wide-reaching source material
presently used in disaggregated conflict event coding. Every ACLED event is composed
from at least one source. Their names or acronym are noted in the source column. With
the exception of local sources who aim to remain anonymous, the publication details are
sufficient to enable a data user to find the original source name with ease. If more than
two sources are used, the most thorough report is cited, or all are noted in alphabetical
order in the ‘SOURCE’ column. Researchers may often refer to more than one report to
confirm the details of an event but will note the source with the most thorough and
unbiased information in the ‘SOURCE’ column. If that event has additional information
taken from more than one source, both report sources are noted in the ‘SOURCE’
column. The ‘SOURCE SCALE’ column describes whether the sources used for coding an event
operate at the local, subnational, national, regional, international, or at another level.
One scale over another does not guarantee more direct information, accuracy, or
legitimacy, but ACLED supports gathering and using local sources whenever possible.
ACLED has arrangements and partnerships with many local organizations for data
exchange in pursuance of this goal.
