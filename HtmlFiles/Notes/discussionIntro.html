      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        There are many things we could look at from this dashboard, in fact, I
        would love to add much more, combine this with other data perhaps, add
        locations to the spatstat plots, but, time is limited. So I've included
        one example exploratory analysis, concluding the dashboard's contents.
        The screenshots of the estimated intensity functions below are from the
        "Point Pattern: Intensity" tab, for which I used the default options. I
        had nothing particular in mind, when I decided to take screenshots of
        the estimated intensity function, and voronoi diagram, at monthly
        intervals from January 2022 to December 2022, for Armed Clashes and
        Shelling/Missile/Artillery Attacks, for the entirety of Ukraine. Simply,
        I thought it would be a good idea, considering, these two events
        encompass a large portion of event types in my dataset, because, perhaps
        I could see something I could not see from the multiple bar chart, or
        maps box, and indeed I did. There is a lot to observe, so I'll go month
        by month. I'll use SAM to denote Shelling/Artillery/Missile.

      <h4>Example Exploratory Analysis</h4>
      <p>
        In January, Armed clashes and SAM attacks seem to be relatively in
        common from the Kernel estimated intensities, and Voronoi diagrams. One
        must remember that these are fixed bandwidth smoothers, which tend to
        smooth out the boundaries between high and low intensity areas, and
        evidently, it has a large smoothing bandwidth, so that explains the
        large discrepancy between the Voronoi diagram and Kernel estimated
        intensity. In February, we can see armed clashes in the east are
        creeping westward, and there is a number of armed clashes near the
        north-center part of the country (I think is Kyiv). The shellings have
        stayed pretty much the same for the kernel estimation graph, but the
        Voronoi Diagram tells a different story. Again, this is the discrepancy
        of using this particular default setting, areas of low intensity SAM
        attacks don't appear at all in the west. The Voronoi Diagram is saying
        something is happening similar to the Voronoi diagram of armed clashes,
        but also there is a marked increase in SAM attacks in the east. In
        March, we can see that SAM attacks start appearing in the west along
        with an uptake in armed clashes in that area. The Voronoi diagrams tells
        us that there is a general increase in SAM attacks and armed clashes in
        the east. In April, looking at the estimated intensities, armed clashes
        and SAM attacks have altogether disapeared in the Kyiv region (although
        the Voronoi diagram says that some SAM attacks occurred), and both
        intensities seem to have receded eastward, but armed clashes are still
        appearing in the South. What should be evident from the Voronoi
        diagrams, if you look at them in succession (especially after April),
        there is sort of a shape being formed by smaller polygons, additionally,
        the SAM attacks have a more defined shape, and are encroaching eastward. And evidently, the number of armed clashes seems to diminish. 
        This reminded me of listening to podcast on geopolitics about Ukraine. In particular for the winter months I heard that it was going to be 
        a war of attrition, that is, a lot of shelling eachother, not a lot of offensives, I heard the ground freezes over too, so seeing the number 
        of armed clashes decrease and SAM attacks increase, I think, may legitimately be provided as evidence for that. Of course, any analyst, who's job 
        is to study war and comb through thousands of reports by government officials and media on how the war is going, in addition to looking at satellite 
        imagery to confirm those statements, from what I understand the people at the Institute for the Study of War are doing, they probably don't need these 
        evidential assists.
