  ... statistical methodology for spatial point processes (as used in this book) is based largely on assumption that 
  point processes are simple, i.e. that points of the process can never be coincident. [Pg. 60]
  
  For a marked point pattern, two points are declared to be identical when their coordinates and their marks are 
  identical. Two points at the same location but with different marks are not considered duplicates [Pg. 60]
  
  What to do about duplicated points is often unclear; it depends on the context and on the objectives of the analysis.
  An alternative to deleting duplicate points is to perturb the coordinates slightly using rjitter. Another alternative is
  to make the points of the pattern unique using unique, and to attach the multiplicities of the points to the pattern as marks.

  Circular (or disc-shaped) and elliptical windows are created by the spatstat functions disc and ellipse. [Pg. idk
  somewhere near 60] 
  
  A point process is a rnadom mechanism whose outcome is a point pattern [Pg. 127]
  
  Are the points spread uniformly over the survey region? Does the density of points depend on an explanatory variable?
  Are the points randomly scattered? Is there evidence of clustering? Is the spatial pattern consistent with my scientific 
  hypothesis? How accurate/reliable is my statistical analysis? 
  
  These are not questions about the points, but about the way the points are generated. But in analysing the data we aim
  to learn about the spatial pattern of crime or the spatially varying risk of road accidents, to gain insight into the 
  underlying causes.
