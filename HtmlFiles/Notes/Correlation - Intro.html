        <h4>What is correlation?</h4>
        <p>Correlation is generally meant as a measure of stochastic dependence. In a simple linear regression context, with response y and explanatory variable x, correlation is a measure of linear association between y and x. When one x goes up, does y tend to go up? Similarly, correlation for spatial point patterns is a measure of stochastic dependence, but stochastic dependence between points. Point patterns are said to be positively correlated (positive covariance) if the points tend to want to stay close to one another. In the other direction, if points tend to stay away from eachother, this is called inhibition/regularity/repulsion, the points are said to be negatively correlated (negative covariance). </p>
