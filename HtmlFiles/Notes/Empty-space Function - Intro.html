      <h4>What is the empty space function?</h4>
      <p>
        Mathematically in a 2-D plane, the empty space distance can be defined
        as
        <span class="math display"
          ><em>d</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>X</em>) = <em>m</em><em>i</em
          ><em>n</em>{||<em>u</em> − <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub
          >|| : <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub
          > ∈ <em>X</em>}</span
        >, where u is a arbitrary fixed location, X is a point pattern, and
        <span class="math display"
          ><em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span
        >
        is a point in the point pattern. The empty-space function, defined for
        all distances <span class="math display"><em>r</em> ≥ 0</span>, is
        <span class="math display"
          ><em>F</em
          >(<em>r</em>) = <em>P</em>{<em>d</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>X</em>) ≤ <em>r</em>}</span
        >. This is the cumulative distribution function of the empty-space
        distance and may be interpreted as follows:
        <b
          >The values of F(r) are probabilities (between 0 and 1) giving, for
          any fixed reference location u, the chance that there will be a point
          of X lying within distance r of this location.</b
        >. In a similar fashion to the K-Function, we compare the empirical
        empty space function estimated from the data, with the empty space
        function for a homogeneous poisson process (for a completely random
        pattern). The estimator used in this dashboard for the empty space
        function assume that the point process is stationary, and
        <b
          >experience suggests that the choice of edge correction is not very
          important so long as some edge correction is performed.</b
        >
      </p>
      <h4>Interpretation</h4>
      <p>
        The interpretation of the empirical empty space function F(r), is
        opposite of that of the K-Function, if the empirical empty-space
        function is above the theoretical version for a homogeneous poisson
        process with the same average intensity, this means for
        <b
          >for a given distance r, the estimated probability that
          <span class="math display"
            ><em>d</em>(<em>u</em>,<em>X</em>) ≤ <em>r</em></span
          >
          is greater than it would be in a completely random pattern.
          Consequently the empty-space distances are shorter than expected if
          the pattern were completely random. This is consistent with a regular
          pattern.</b
        >
        Similarly if the empirical empty space function estimated from the data
        is below the theoretical version for a homogeneous poisson process with
        the same average intensity, this means that the probability for a given
        distance r, that a arbitrary location u will have a point of X lying
        within a distance r is lower than that of a completely random pattern,
        indicating that
        <b>
          the empty-space distances are larger than would be expected if the
          corresponding pattern were completely random; this is consistent with
          clustering.</b
        >
      </p>

      <h4>Inhomogeneous Version</h4>
      <p>
        There is a inhomogeneous version, details of which can be found in
        M.N.M. van Lieshout. A J-function for inhomogeneous point patterns. The
        required assumption is that the
        <b
          >'k-point correlation functions' for all
          <span class="math display"><em>k</em> ≥ 2</span> are invariant under
          translations</b
        >, with the additional assumption that the true intensity function is
        positive for all locations u.
