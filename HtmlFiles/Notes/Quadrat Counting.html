      <h4>Quadrat Counting</h4>
      <p>This graphic is included to let the user know the "unweighted" intensity of events in the observation window. Assuming, the point pattern is from a stationary point process, quadrat counting can be used as a method for checking for spatial inhomogeneity, by dividing the observation window into quadrats (or regions) and counting the 
      number of points in each quadrat. But in our graphic, the number of points in a quadrat is not weighted, so the numbers displayed in the quadrats do not show how many events are in each quadrat, instead they show how many unique locations of events are in each quadrat. There are formal statistical tests based on quadrat counting however no details about them will be provided here.
