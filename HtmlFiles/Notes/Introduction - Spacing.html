      <h4>Spacing</h4>
      <p>Although the K-Function is a popular tool for assessing interpoint interaction, <b>additional information about a point pattern can often be revealed by measuring spacings or shortest distances in the pattern, such as the 'nearest-neighbour' distances from each data point to the nearest other data point.</b> Furthermore, there is a <b>duality between measuring shortest distances between points and counting points in a given area</b>. Consider for example, you may be interested in the spatial distribution of air/drone strikes in an area surrounding a particular city. In one way, you may look and find that there are on average 2 air/drone strikes within a 10 mile radius of a air/drone strike occuring in the city. In another way, you may find that on average a drone strike occurs roughly 5 miles between every air/drone strike. These statements are not necessarily equal, but convey similar information about the spatial distribution of air/drone strikes. </p>

      <h4>What does it tell us?</h4>
      <p>The nearest neighbour distance distribution function and empty space function are used to assess interpoint interaction (spatial correlation) just as the K-Function does, but it does it by using the distances between points, instead of counting the number of r-neighbours a point has. </p>

      <h4>Measuring Distances</h4>
      <p>
        There are several ways to measure distances in a point pattern. 
        <ul>
            <li>Nearest Neighbour Distances: The distance from a point to its nearest neighbour.</li>
            <li>The empty-space distance: <b> The distance from a fixed reference location u in the window to the nearest data point.</b></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
