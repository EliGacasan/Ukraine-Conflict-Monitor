      <h4>Stienen Diagram</h4>
      <p>
        <b>The Stienen diagram of a point pattern is obtained by drawing a circle around each data point, of diamater equal to its nearest-neighbour distance. Imagine circular balloons, centred at each point of the point pattern, growing at a constant rate. Each balloon stops growing when it touches another balloon... circles are shaded in grey if they are observed without edge effects - that is, if the observed nearest-neighbour distance is shorter than the distance to the window boundary. </b> If a pair of circles are touching eachother, then it means that those two points are nearest neighbours.
