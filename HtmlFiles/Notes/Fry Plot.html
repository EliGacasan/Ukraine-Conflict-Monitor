        <h4>Fry Plot</h4>
        <p> <b>Fry plots are implicitly based on the assumption that the underlying process is stationary. Under this assumption, the Fry plot contains essentially all information about correlations in the point process. If the underlying process is stationary, then the interpretation of the fry plot is as follows as given by the R documentation (spatstat, function <i>fryplot</i>), "A void around the origin in the Fry plot suggests regularity (inhibition between points) and the shape of the void gives a clue to anisotropy in the pattern." If there is high concentration of points in the middle, it indicates that this is a clustered pattern. </p>
