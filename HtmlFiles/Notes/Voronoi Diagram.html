      <p>From above  source: <b>To form a Voronoi tessellation, consider a collection of points scattered on some space, like the plane, where itâ€™s easier to picture things, especially when using a Euclidean metric. Now for each point in the collection, consider the surrounding region that is closer to that point than any other point in the collection. Each region forms a cell corresponding to the point. The union of all the sets covers the underlying space. That union of sets is the Voronoi tessellation.</b></p>
