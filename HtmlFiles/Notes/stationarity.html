  <h3>Stationarity and Isotropism</h3>
  <p>
    A point process is stationarity if, when we look at the point pattern at any
    given region, the statistical properties of the point process do not change.
    This would be akin to stationarity in time series. A point process is
    isotropic if the statistical properties of the process do not change if the
    process is rotated. A point process can be isotropic and not stationary,
    stationarity and not isotropic, both stationary and isotropic, or
    non-stationary and anisotropic. For our purposes, we assume that our point
    process is non-stationary and anisotropic. It is clear that where people
    choose to protest or fight is not going to be random, there is some
    underlying process that determines that, for example it could be a railroad
    station that acts as a means of transportation for military purposes, maybe
    it holds some strategic significance, so it has some connection to whether
    or not fighting may occur there. Some of the methods that displayed in this
    app are supposed to only be applied and interpreted for stationary point
    processes, but they have been included nonetheless.
